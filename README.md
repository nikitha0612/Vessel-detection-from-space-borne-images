# Vessel-detection-from-space-borne-images

• Developed a Machine Learning model that detects and segments vessels from the satellite images. 

• The public data set from Kaggle with more than 200K satellite images are taken and trained on Resnet-50 classifier to detect vessel in the satellite image .

• The vessel if detected is then masked using Mask RCNN. Achieved an accuracy of 83.75% for 30 epochs and batch size of 32.
